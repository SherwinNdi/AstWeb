The [Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior (SSIB)](https://www.ssib.org/2025/index.php) successfully concluded its 32nd Annual Meeting, held from July 28th to August 1st at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford, United Kingdom. This year’s meeting featured a remarkable lineup of talks and presentations, addressing cutting-edge research topics including the genetics of thinness, eating behavior in children, food insecurity and the microbiome, social influences on eating, and the physiological underpinnings of life’s great pleasures: eating.

Esteemed speakers included Sadaf Farooqi from the University of Cambridge, UK; John I. Glendinning, Ann Whitney Olin Professor of Biology at Barnard College, Columbia University; Marion M. Hetherington from the University of Leeds and Penn State University; Daniel Nettle from Institut Jean Nicod, CNRS, Paris, France; John Cryan from University College Cork, Ireland; and Suzanne Higgs from the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK.

The OBRAIN Lab was proudly represented at the meeting with a poster presentation by alumni Filip Morys (McGill University, MNEURO) and Hendrik Hartmann, showcasing their work on “Structural brain differences in metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy obesity in the UK Biobank sample.”

Additionally, Arsene Kanyamibwa delivered an engaging 12-minute presentation on [“Ultraprocessed food consumption affects structural integrity of feeding-related brain regions independent of and via adiposity,”](https://www.ssib.org/2025/program.php?page=program&displayday=4&pads=&start_range=&start_interval=&changing_days=yes&hide_details=) sparking thoughtful discussions among attendees.
