The symposium will be chaired by [Stephanie Borgland](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/physiology-pharmacology/stephanie-borgland) and the speakers are Stephanie Borgland, [Fabien Naneix](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/fabien.naneix/), [Serge Luquet](https://bfa.u-pariscite.fr/), & Annette Horstmann (presenting [work from O’BRAIN lab’s Arsene and Filip](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44324-025-00056-3)).
