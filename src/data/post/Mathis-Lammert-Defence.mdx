On 17 July 2025, our former colleague Mathis Lammert (MD) defended his doctoral thesis at the University of Leipzig’s Medical Faculty: “Gut-Brain Interactions after Bariatric Surgery – on the Relationship of Gut Hormones and Working Memory in Postoperative Weight Loss Variability.” His defense talk was titled “Das Zusammenspiel von Darm und Hirn nach bariatrischer Chirurgie.”
Mathis completed his dissertation under the guidance of Prof. Annette Horstmann, Prof. Wiebke Fenske, and Prof. Arno Villringer. Along the way, his work contributed to two publications:

- [Distinct adaptations of endocrine and cognitive functions may contribute to high variability in long-term weight loss outcome after bariatric surgery (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938423002044)

- [Metabolic profile and metabolite analyses in extreme weight responders to gastric bypass surgery (2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/12/5/417)

We’re proud of Mathis for finishing this journey so successfully and wish him all the best for what’s next!
