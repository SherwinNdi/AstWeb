We are happy to share that a doctoral researcher in our lab has received a continuation grant to support their work from November 2025 to November 2026. Building on previous successes, this funding will allow the investigation of how unconscious signals to the brain’s reward system affect food choices in our modern, obesity-promoting environment.

The research will focus on examining combinations of macronutrients—specifically carbohydrates and fats—along with the impact of food processing on food motivation. By combining food questionnaires and behavioral tasks as proxies for food reward, this study aims to deepen our understanding of how modern diets influence eating behaviors across individuals with varying body mass indices (BMIs).

For additional background, please refer to last year’s [announcement](https://obrainlab.com/grant-news/).

We warmly congratulate [Arsene](https://obrainlab.com/members/arsene-kanyamibwa/) on this achievement and look forward to the important insights their work will bring in the coming year.
